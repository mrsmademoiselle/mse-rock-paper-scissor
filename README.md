# Clean Code Development

A small assignment by my university module "modern software development".

  <summary>Peak assignment</summary>
  Become a 'conscious' Clean Coder!

1. Go through the Clean Code Developer (CCD) website! Create your own checklist or cheat sheet.

2. Write a short program yourself that contains only perfect Clean Code!

Alternatively, you can (provably) take your own code and refactor it from dirty to clean.

For ideas, please Google 'Code Kata'.

For example, something as simple as Tic-Tac-Toe or the Matchstick game would be sufficient!

(Note: You have a certain number N of matchsticks. Players must take 1-3 matchsticks alternately. The goal is to implement a winning strategy where the computer always wins if it dictates N or starts first!)

Two notes:
- The game/code should not include elaborate graphics. A bit of console output is sufficient. It's about the code!
- The target language is arbitrary!

Explain why the code is considered Clean Code! Provide explanations!

The CCD cheatsheet as well as the code explanations were provided on another platform.
